          At Found Diverse, we work to advance <br />cultural diversity in start-ups. By harnessing<br />
          the full potential of talents of all genders, ages,<br />
          and cultural backgrounds, the start-up scene will <br />
          not only become more inclusive – it will also be better fit<br />
          to meet the varied challenges we are facing.<br />
          Change is necessary. And it’s here to stay!

          Found Diverse is an NGO with the purpose of advancing <br />
          inclusion and diversity to maximise the potential in the <br />
          establishment and growth of new companies. Change<br />
          has begun but it isn’t finished in the blink of an eye. <br />We need to join forces to accelerate the shift from <br />mono- to multi-culture. <br /><br />We provide a platform for a range
          of initiatives working <br />
          towards our common goal: advancing diversity in<br />
          the start-up scene to ensure that people of all cultural <br />
          backgrounds have access to talent, innovation,<br />
          and an equal distribution of funding.
